# My first reflection

Joined class late so catching up now.

Basic syntaxes are # for header, ** for **bold** and _ for _italicizing_.

also using [square brackets followed by a link after creates a hyperlink](https://www.google.ca).

* Just learnt that it is very important to add the "http/https" part otherwise the link wont properly redirect.
